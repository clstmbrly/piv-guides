User often needs to access remote UNIX-like server through network. The risk is weak login method could be impersonated and traffic could be sniffed. PIV can provide strong authentication and hard to inpersonante; ssl can prevent network data sniffing. PIV with SSH can provide both of abov strong security measures. Public key provided in PIV is authorized in form  of certificate signed by authroized CA certificate.
To use Secure Shell (SSH) for remote access to a UNIX-like server, you need to first authenticate your PIV. PIV authentication and SSH can be done from a Windows, Linux, or Mac-based computer. You also need to configure the UNIX-like server that you want to remotely access.

Select the link for your operating system (OS). Please also review _Configure a UNIX-like Server_.

## Use PIV for SSH from a Windows Computer

### Hardware and software requirements

  * A PIV
  * Windows computer
  * A smartcard reader
  * PuTTY-CAC application (an open-source SSH client that supports PIV authentication)
  * Pageant application (an SSH authentication agent used with PuTTY-CAC)

     > _You will download **PuTTY-CAC** and **Pageant** in the steps below._

### Procedures

These steps will help you to:

  * Authenticate your PIV.
  * Ensure that your Windows computer and SSH server recognize your PIV.
  * Enable the correct drivers on your computer for SSH.

#### Install PuTTY-CAC

  1. Download and install [**PuTTY-CAC**](https://www.github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases){:target="_blank"}_. 
  
     > _Within the application, PuTTY-CAC is referred to simply as "**PuTTY**." 
     > PuTTY will usually be installed at **C:\Program Files\PuTTY**._
     
  2. Open PuTTY and click on **About** (lower left-hand corner of the **PuTTY Configuration** window) to ensure that the correct version was installed.

#### Use PIV to insert Microsoft CAPI key into Pageant
 
The **CAPI key** is the "Smart Card certificate" discussed in Step 9.   

  1. Insert your **PIV** into the smartcard reader.
  2. Open **Windows Explorer**.
  3. Open **Pageant** and go to **C: &gt; Program Files &gt; PuTTY &gt; Pageant**.

     > _A window will not open, but the **Pageant** icon will appear at the bottom of the screen in the Windows taskbar._

  4. Right-click on the **Pageant** icon and select **View Keys &amp; Certs**.

     > _The Pageant **Key/CAPI Cert List** window will open._

  5. Click on **Add Cert**.
  6. Select your **Smart Card Logon** certificate from the **Windows Security** window.
  7. To ensure that this is the correct certificate, click on **Click here to view certificate properties &gt; Details**.
  8. Locate and click on **Enhanced Key Usage**. You should see the **Smart Card Logon**. (This means that the certificate is the right type.) Click on **OK** to close the window.

     > _If multiple certificates exist, you may want to clear the expired or revoked certificates._

  9. Click on the **Smart Card certificate** to highlight it. Then click on **OK** and **Close**.

     > _The Pageant window will populate with the certificate information.
     > Every time you start Pageant, you must re-add the certificate._

#### Configure PuTTY

##### Set up a PIV login profile

  1. Right-click on the **Pageant** icon from the Windows taskbar. Select **New Session** to launch **PuTTY**.

     > _Use PuTTY to set up a new PIV login profile for a SSH server. 
     > To create new profiles for multiple SSH servers, repeat Steps 2-6 for each SSH server._

  2. Enter the **IP address** of the SSH server in the **Host Name (or IP address)** textbox. (If you already have a profile for the SSH server, select it, and click on the **Load** button. Otherwise, follow Steps 3-6 to set up the profile.)
  3. Enter a session name into the **Saved Sessions** textbox.
  4. From the left **Category**: panel, select **Connection &gt; SSH &gt; CAPI**. Then, click on the checkbox for **Attempt "CAPI Certificate" (Key-only) auth (SSH-2)**.
  5. From within the **PuTTY Configuration** window, select **Connection &gt; SSH &gt; Auth**. Next, click on the checkboxes for **Allow agent forwarding** and **Allow attempted changes of username in SSH-2**.
  6. Finally, click on **Session** from the left panel and enter a name in the **Saved Session** textbox. Click on the **Save** button.

##### Obtain PIV's SSH key

  1. To get your PIV's **SSH key**, go to the **PuTTY Configuration** window. In the left panel, click on **Connection &gt; SSH&nbsp;&gt; CAPI**.  Under **Authentication Parameters**, click on  the **Browse** button.  

     > _This automatically fills in the **Cert** and **SSH keystring** textboxes._

  2. Copy and paste the **SSH keystring**&nbsp;**_value_** (i.e., SSH key) into **Microsoft Notepad** and save it.  
  3. Provide your SSH key to the SSH server administrator and ask that it be added to your SSH server account.

     > _Once the SSH server account has been set up with your SSH key, you can use your PIV to log in. 
     > For other SSH servers, submit a service ticket to the administrator and include the IP address of the SSH server you are using, your account name, and your PIV's SSH key._

#### Verify your PuTTY login and proceed with SSH

  1. Run **PuTTY** and select the **Saved Session**.
  2. Click on **Load** and then on **Open**.
  3. Enter your **remote UNIX/Linux account name**.  
  4. At the prompt, enter your **PIV card PIN** and click on **OK** to log into the remote server.
  5. Once logged in, run the command: **ssh-add –l** to display the SSH key.  

     > _For each server you "jump" to, use **ssh-add –l** to display the SSH key. Once you see the key, you may **ssh** to any other host in the environment._

## Configure a UNIX-like Server

### Procedures

These steps will help you to configure a UNIX-like server for remote access.

  1. Change the configuration in the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file and restart the **sshd**:

      ```
		AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/sshd/authorized_keys/%u
		PasswordAuthentication No
      ```

  2. Create the directory, **/etc/sshd/authorized_keys**:

        ```
			mkdir /etc/sshd/authorized_keys
        ```

  3. To allow one user to have access, place the user's PIV's SSH public key in this directory, according to the user's name: **/etc/sshd/authorized_keys/[login ID]**. 
  
       >_Only a **root user** may modify this directory and its files. This ensures that access requirements are enforced._  
  
  4. Disable any alternative means of access (i.e., via passwords), as needed.
