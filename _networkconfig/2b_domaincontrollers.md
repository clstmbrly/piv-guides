NEED INTRO


(formerly Use Case--convert to Intro, per JP)_We would like to use a local enterprise Microsoft CA to issue a Domain Controller certificate to the Domain Controller server. The server must have a certificate installed with the appropriate fields/values as a prerequisite to enabling authorized users with PIV credentials (i.e., PIV cards) to log into domain-connected devices._

### Prerequisite

  * The server that hosts the CA must be joined to the domain
  * The CA should never reside on the same server(s) that are acting as Domain Controller(s)
  * You must be an Enterprise Administrator in the domain to perform these steps

## Install CA role

replace the clicks etc with simple ->


  1. Log into the **CA server** as a member of the **Enterprise Administrators** group.
  2. Open the **Server Manager**.
  3. Click on **Manage**, and then click on **Add Roles and Features**.
  4. Proceed through the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** options. Choose the following:
     * Server Roles: **_Active Directory Certificate Services_**
     * AD CS Roles Services: **_Certification Authority_** 
  5. On the **Results** page, click on **Configure Active Directory Certificate Services on the destination server**.
  6. Proceed through the **AD CS Configuration** options. Choose the following, as necessary:
     1. Role Service: **_Certification Authority_** 
     2. Setup Type: **_Enterprise CA_** 
     3. CA Type: **_Root CA_**
     4. Private Key: **_Create a new private key_** 
     5. Cryptography: **_RSA#Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider, 2048 bit, SHA-256 6e_**
     6. CA Name: Use the recommended naming convention:
        **dc=[_AD suffix_], dc=[_AD domain_], cn=[_certification authority name_]** 
        (e.g., dc=_gov_, dc=_[AgencyName]_, cn=_[AgencyName]_ _NPE_ _CA1_) 
     7. Validity Period: **_6 years_** 
     8. Certificate Database: **_&lt;your preference&gt;_** 

## Configure Certificate template for Domain Controller

  1. Log into the CA server as a member of the **Enterprise Administrators** group.
  2. Open the certificate template's **MMC snap-in** (i.e., **certtmpl.msc**). 
  3. Right-click on the **Domain Controller Authentication** template, and then click on **Duplicate Template**.
  4. Under the **Compatibility** tab, modify the **Compatibility Settings** for both the _CA_ and _certificate recipients_ to the highest version compatibility as possible (e.g., **Windows Server 2012 R2** or **Windows 2008 R2**).
  5. Under the **General** tab, we recommend the following settings:
     1. Template Name:  rename to:  **_&lt;Your organization&gt; - Domain Controller Authentication_**.
     2. Validity Period:  **_3 years_**.
     3. Renewal Period:  **_6 weeks_**.
  6. Under the **Cryptography** tab, set the following values:
     1. Minimum Key Size:  **_2048_**.
     2. Request Hash:  **_SHA256_** (if possible).
  7. Open the **CA console** (i.e., **certsrv.msc**).
  8. In the **console tree**, click on the **_[CA's name]_**.
  9. In the **details** pane, double-click on **Certificate Templates**.
 10. In the **console tree**, right-click on **Certificate Templates** and click on **New**. Then, click on **Certificate Template To Issue**.
 11. Select and enable the **_certificate template_** that was created, and then click on **OK**

## Auto-enroll Domain Controllers using Group Policy Object (GPO)**

  1. Log into a **Domain Controller server** as a member of the **Enterprise Administrators** group.
  2. Open the **GPMC** (i.e. **gpmc.msc** ).
  3. Within the appropriate **GPO**, navigate to **_Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies\**_
  4. Configure **Certificate Services Client â€“ Auto-Enrollment** with the following options:
     1. Configuration Model: **_Enabled_**.
     2. For Renew Expired Certificates, Update Pending Certificates, Remove Revoked Certificates: **_Check_all checkboxes_**.
     3. Update Certificates That Use Certificate Templates: **_Check the checkbox_**.
  5. At the command line, you can now force the group policy to update via the command: **_gpupdate /force_** or wait for the group policy to update on its own.
  6. If successful, you will see a new Domain Controller certificate in the **_Certificate (Local Computer) -&gt; Personal -&gt; Certificates folder_** (e.g., **_open MMC.exe -&gt; File -&gt; Add/Remove Snap-in -&gt;Certificates -&gt;Computer account -&gt;Local computer)_**.
  
  > At the **Certificate Template** tab, you should see a certificate generated with the custom certificate template.
